        <h1>Akan Names</h1>
        <div class="description">
          <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order
            in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the
            person. Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an
            ancestor's middle name. Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an
            English or Christian name. Notable figures with day names include Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah and
            former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</p>
